# Modelica Notes

This repository contains notes and resources for learning and studying the Modelica language, which is used for modeling and simulating complex physical systems across various domains such as engineering and science.

## About

The purpose of this repository is to provide structured notes, examples, and exercises for anyone looking to learn or work with the Modelica language. The materials are organized into subdirectories, each containing a set of related learning resources, code examples, and explanations.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized by date-based or topic-based subdirectories, where each folder contains resources related to specific aspects of the Modelica language. You will typically find:

- **Modelica examples**: Code snippets and models that demonstrate the use of Modelica.
- **Notes and explanations**: Detailed materials to help understand Modelica concepts, libraries, and syntax.

## Clean Up

If you've previously run Modelica simulations or tests and generated unnecessary files, you can clean up the repository by using the provided `clean.sh` script. This will remove any redundant files from past executions.

To use the script:

```bash
./clean.sh
```

Make sure the script has execution permissions by running:

```bash
chmod +x clean.sh
```
